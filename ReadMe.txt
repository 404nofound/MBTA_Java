Yichang Shao's Final Project Topic and Requirement

A train prediction and route planning system

**************************************************

# Features:

* User can input their location - address.

* User can input which train stop they want to go.

* User can choose which type of route they want, default is walking. (Drive, Bicycle).

* System will return back detailed route info to help user find stop.

* User can check and view every train's all stops.

* User can check and view every stops' trains time prediction (When arrive and departure).

* System can help user to check whether they can catch up a special train if they walk from their location to that stop.


# Wish List:

* Store all search record, so system can recall directly to return back info quickly.

* User can choose a time period to ask system making a train prediction, not just get current time.
